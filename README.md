This project is mainly used to learn embedded Rust.

## Hardware ##

This project targets the STM32F411CEU6 "Black Pill" board sold by Adafruit:
https://www.adafruit.com/product/4877.

This project also uses a PIR sensor available from Ebay, Amazon, and likely many other online electronics
sellers. The sensor just pulls a pin high or low depending on motion and the microcontroller is able to
respond to the changing signal.
